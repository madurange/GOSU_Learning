# GOSU_Learning
Gosu is a general-purpose programming language built on top of the Java Virtual Machine.  Designed by: Guidewire Software, Released on April 5, 2017  
 Features:
• object-oriented
• easy to learn, especially for programmers familiar with Java
• static typing, which helps you find errors at compile time
• imperative
• Java compatible, which means you can use Java types, extend Java types, and implement Java interfaces
• type inference, which greatly simplifies your code while still preserving static typing
• blocks, which are in-line functions that you can pass around as objects. (closures or lambda expressions)
• enhancements, which add functions and properties to other types, even Java types. Gosu includes built-in
enhancements to common Java classes, some of which add features that are unavailable in Java (such as
blocks).
• generics, which abstracts the behavior of a type to work with multiple types of objects. The Gosu generics
implementation is 100% compatible with Java, and adds additional powerful improvements.
• XML/XSD support
• web service (SOAP) support
• an extensible type system, which means that custom type loaders can dynamically inject types into the
language.
• large companies around the world use Gosu every day in production systems for critical systems.
